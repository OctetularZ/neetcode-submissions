# O(n) | where 'n' is the length of s (or t), solution - Loop through every letter in s and then every letter in t
# If the letter of s is available in t, then continue. If we reach the end of s, then we can return true
# Otherwise if we reach the end of t and we still haven't reached the end of s, then we can return False.

# Another solution is to use a hashmap storing key-value pairs of a character and its positions.
# This method will still be O(n) in respect to length of 's' as we still need to go through every letter
