# Loop through string
# Use a stack to store file directories
# Hold current directory name which will be added onto until a slash is found
# When slash is found, add directory name to stack and reset variable holding name
# If name slash is found and variable is empty, don't add anything to stack
# Another variable can be used to keep count of periods seen until we hit a slash
# When we hit a slash, reset to 0.
# Otherwise, keep counting periods.
# If we hit slash and periods more == 2, pop from stack
# If period just 1, do nothing and reset.
