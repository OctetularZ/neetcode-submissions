# Stack - Only store letters and numbers
# Iterate though characters in s
# Global variable to keep track of result string
# Add each character to stack until close bracket is reached
# When close bracket is reached, add string to start of global variable
# When a number is reached, multiply global variable by number
# When end of s is reached, add any remaining letters to end of res
# Another variable to store current string we are building so we can add to stack
