# Least weight capacity - The smallest number we can use so the weights can be shipped in 'days' days
# So if we output 10 - We can only load a maximum of 10 per day (using the weights in order)
# Get the maximum weight from weights
# Start binary search between 0 and max of weights
# How to check number of days required by current capacity (O(n)):
    # Use a for loop and current capacity counter
    # If current capacity more than or equal to max capacity:
        # Add 1 to current days counter
        # Then minus max capacity from current capacity
# Restore min(days, current days counter)
# If current days counter more than days, search right side of range
# Otherwise search left side if current days less than days
# We have to find a capacity which gives us exactly days

# O(n log (n))
